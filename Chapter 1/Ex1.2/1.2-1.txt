Web-based service that determines how to travel from one location to another.
Its implementation would rely on fast hardware, a graphical user interface,
wide-area networking, and also possibly on object orientation. However,
it would also require algorithms for certain operations, such as finding routes
(probably using a shortest-path algorithm), rendering maps, andinterpolating
addresses. Moreover, even an application that does not require algorithmic content at the
application level relies heavily upon algorithms. Does the application rely on fast
hardware? The hardware design used algorithms. Does the application rely on
graphical user interfaces? The design of any GUI relies on algorithms. Does the
application rely on networking? Routing in networks relies heavily on algorithms.
Was the application written in a language other than machine code? Then it was
processed by a compiler, interpreter, or assembler, all of which make extensive use
of algorithms. Algorithms are at the core of most technologies used in contemporary computers.
